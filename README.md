## TkinterCAD Projects Review
**Playlist Link:** [TinkerCAD Projects](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWqnlHhsmcI4eBDLBtaZs16XZq0WL1SlP) 

### What I did -
- Studied **Arduino projects** from the playlist, including their **circuit designs** and **code logic**.
- Carefully analyzed and **understood the code** line by line.
- Explained the purpose of each **function**, **variable**, and **hardware component**.
- **Rebuilt the circuit diagrams** independently using my understanding of the wiring.
- Provided a detailed explanation of **how the circuit and code work together** to achieve the desired behavior.
